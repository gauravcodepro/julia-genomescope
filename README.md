# julia-pacbiohifiKmerprofile.jl

- julia implementation of the kmer profiles and genomescope.
- genomscope maths to include and will plot the genomescope profiles for both the assembled genomes and pacbiohifireads.
- currently gives all the profiles kmers for the pacbiohifi reads.
- 100GB pacbiohif reads parsed in less than 15-20 minutes.
- implementing memory borrowing by RUST bindings to make it much faster. Havent wrote RUST in last couple of months.
